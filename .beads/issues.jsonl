{"id":"hyperpowers-95j","title":"Add context: fork option to systematic-debugging skill","description":"## Summary\n\nAdd support for `context: fork` to the systematic-debugging skill, allowing its heavy 4-phase investigation process to run in an isolated sub-agent context.\n\n## Background\n\nThe systematic-debugging skill is one of the most investigation-heavy skills in the library:\n\n- **4 rigorous phases:** Root Cause Investigation → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation\n- **11 supporting files:** root-cause tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based waiting, test scenarios, etc.\n- **Extensive exploration:** reading errors, git diffs, stack traces, running diagnostics, comparing code patterns\n- **Scientific method enforcement:** hypothesis forming, minimal testing, verification loops\n\n## Why Fork Would Benefit This Skill\n\n**Token efficiency:**\n- Investigation involves many file reads, grep searches, git operations\n- Evidence gathering (logging component boundaries, tracing data flow) produces verbose output\n- Failed hypotheses and their tests consume tokens but aren't needed afterward\n\n**Context cleanliness:**\n- The investigation *journey* (hypotheses tried, evidence gathered, dead ends) pollutes main context\n- The investigation *result* (root cause identified, fix verified) is what matters for subsequent work\n- Main session stays focused on implementation rather than debugging archaeology\n\n**Clean handoff:**\n- When debugging completes, return to main context with:\n  - Root cause summary\n  - The fix applied\n  - Test verification\n- Not the full trail of hypothesis → test → fail → new hypothesis loops\n\n## Proposed Change\n\nAdd `context: fork` to the skill frontmatter:\n\n\\`\\`\\`yaml\n---\nname: systematic-debugging\ndescription: Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior\ncontext: fork\n---\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Users may sometimes want to see the full investigation trail in main context\n- Could be made configurable (fork by default, with option to run inline)\n- Related skill `superpowers:test-driven-development` referenced in Phase 4 would need coordination if both fork\n\n## Related\n\n- GitHub issue: https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/246\n- Related to brainstorming fork feature (superpowers #245)\n- Claude Code CLI 2.1.2 fork feature","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-10T23:36:36.735134+13:00","created_by":"bradley","updated_at":"2026-01-11T12:04:18.396474+13:00","closed_at":"2026-01-11T12:04:18.396654+13:00"}
